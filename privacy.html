<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>This application uses Keycloak as its identity provider to authenticate users and manage secure access to app
    features.</p>

<p>As part of the authentication process, Keycloak may store and manage personal information such as the user's name and
    email address. This information is maintained within the Keycloak identity server and is not directly accessed,
    collected, or processed by the application itself, except for the technical user ID (subject identifier) required
    for session management.</p>

<p>The application does not store or share personal data with third parties, nor does it use third-party analytics,
    advertising, or tracking tools.</p>

<p>All authentication and access control operations are performed securely using self-hosted infrastructure controlled
    by the application developer.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding your data or privacy, please contact us at <strong>ipfaboslgd@gmail.com</strong>.
